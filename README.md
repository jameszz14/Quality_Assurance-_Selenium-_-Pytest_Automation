## Introduction

In today's fast-paced software development world, quality assurance plays a vital role in delivering reliable products. This repository provides a structured approach to unit testing using Pytest and Selenium. By validating utility functions, we ensure that our applications perform as expected.

## Features

- **Unit Testing**: Validate essential utility functions.
- **Email Validation**: Check if email formats are correct.
- **Selenium Integration**: Automate web testing for functional validation.
- **Easy Setup**: Quick installation and configuration.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear guidelines to help you get started.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to clone it and install the necessary dependencies. Below, we outline the steps to set everything up.

   git clone https://github.com/jameszz14/Quality_Assurance-_Selenium-_-Pytest_Automation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Quality_Assurance-_Selenium-_-Pytest_Automation
   ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

   You can install the necessary packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

After installation, you can run the tests using Pytest. To execute the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

You can also specify a particular test file or directory:

```bash
pytest tests/test_email_validation.py
```

## Directory Structure

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the projectâ€™s directory structure:

```

- **tests/**: Contains all the test files.
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions to be tested.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the required packages.

## Tests

The repository includes unit tests for various utility functions. You can find the test files in the `tests/` directory. Each test file focuses on a specific utility function.

### Example Test: Email Validation

The `test_email_validation.py` file contains tests to validate email formats. The tests ensure that valid emails pass and invalid emails fail.

```python
def test_valid_email():
    assert is_valid_email("test@example.com") == True

def test_invalid_email():
    assert is_valid_email("test@.com") == False
```
